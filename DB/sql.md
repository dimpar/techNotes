## Where vs Having

- difference between **WHERE** and **HAVING** clause in SQL. As I said this is very popular question and you can't afford not to prepare it. Always remember key difference between WHERE and HAVING clause in SQL, if WHERE and HAVING clause is used together, first WHERE clause is applied to filter rows and only after grouping HAVING clause is applied.

- The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG) to group the result-set by one or more columns.

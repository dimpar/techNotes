/*

As we can see, the client only need to do:
Tell the builder of what type of the product
Tell the builder to construct, the step by step will be done in the Builder, the client doesnâ€™t care about the detail process
Tell the builder to print the report when the construction process is done
We can reuse the step by step to create the object and hide the complexity to create it. If there is another new electronic product should be produced, we can just define the new struct and implement the BuildProcess interface, we also achieved the flexibility and scalability in our code.
